<p> It's an automatic way to track changes in software projects, giving creators the power to view previous versions with ease. </p>
<h2>DangerousGittersClub</h2>
<p>The DangeroursGittersClub was founded in 2018. We had the vision to make every developer on earth aware of the prblems which may occur if they work without version control </p>
